				Today I attempted to insert a whole cantaloupe melon into my anus
				because the local shops had run out of apricots (I buy a lot). Using
				about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed
				to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to
				shit it back out. This is where things got confusing because rather than
				a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance
				that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away
				somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots
				lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find
				the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons
				into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once
				my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be
				able to solve world hunger.
